# Day-4
This is the Day 4 of the Data Analyst Internship at Elevate Labs

In this day 4 task we were given to create a interactive dashboard for business stakeholders to provide them insights on their business.

Dataset used : Financial Sample 
Source : Kaggle
Tools Used : Power BI for Data Visualization and EXCEL for Data Cleaning.

In this task I used Power BI to visually represent the sales data of the business stakeholders to provide them quick insights via charts and graphs.
Using this approach I emphasized on the key performance indicators like Total sales, net profit, total number of sales that is how many products have been sold,
most sold product, and from which segment it is, in which month and year did we saw the most number of sales and net profit.

I also used measures created using DAX in power bi and mapping tables for an effective dataset.

I HAVE PROVIDED THE POWER BI DASHBOARD REPORT AND ALSO A PPT REPORT SUMMARISING THE ENTIRE ANALYSIS INSIDE A FOLDER NAMED "DAY 4".


THANK YOU FOR READING THIS AND GIVING ME YOUR PRECIOUS TIME.
